        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the stock by rinsing the beef thoroughly and placing it in a pot. Season with crushed seasoning cubes, salt, curry, ground ginger and garlic, as well as chopped onions. Boil till tender and then seperate the meat from the stock and fry in a seperate pan. Keep the stock and oil used for later.</li>
            <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly and par boil it for 10 minutes. Rinse the parboiled rice with cold water, drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Now is the time to rinse the tomatoes, chilli pepper, scotch bonnet peppers, and onions. Next, blend everything into a smooth puree. Add the puree to a pot and boil till most of the water is evaporated.</li>
            <li>Remove the coconut's flesh and cut into small pieces. Place this into a blender along with some water and blend. Strain off the milk to separate it from the chaff. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fs0knJRy94">this video</a> on how to extract coconut milk. </li>
            <li>Add a spoon of tomato paste to the boiled puree. Add the oil used in frying the meat to the puree to fry it, stirring continuosly for 5 minutes to prevent it from burning.</li>
            <li>Add the beef stock to the fried puree and mix it well. Add the coconut milk, check the salt and spices level and adjust accordingly.  </li>
            <li>Gently add the parboiled rice to the sauce, ensuring that the sauce covers the rice. If not, simply add a little water. Add the bay leaves to the pot and cover.</li>
